title: Never Let Me Go
description: "It was a place of mercurial cliques and mysterious rules where teachers were constantly reminding their charges of how special they were.

Now, years later, Kathy is a young woman. Ruth and Tommy have reentered her life. And for the first time she is beginning to look back at their shared past and understand just what it is that makes them specialâ€”and how that gift will shape the rest of their time together."-- Provided by Amazon

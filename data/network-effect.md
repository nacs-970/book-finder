title: Network Effect
description: "I'm usually alone in my head, and that's where 90 plus percent of my problems are."

When Murderbot's human associates (not friends, never friends) are captured and another not-friend from its past requires urgent assistance, Murderbot must choose between inertia and drastic action.

Drastic action it is, then.

title: Mother of Storms
description: It is 2028. A strike to destroy an illegal Arctic weapons cache has a catastrophic side effect. Massive amounts of energy are liberated from the polar ice, suddenly and radically warming the Earth's climate. In the middle of the Pacific, a gigantic hurricane thousands of miles across is forming, larger than any in human history. A storm with winds of supersonic speed. A storm that changes direction at whim. A storm that refuses to die. A storm so vast it spawns dozens more in its wake. Blinded by intrigue, expedience, and greed, the world's politicians and power brokers ignore the killer storm's threat until it's too late. The death toll climbs to the tens of millions as it savages the Pacific coast, and the smaller storms it spawns are wreaking havoc across the planet. While the survivors scramble for advantage, a handful of courageous men and women undertake a desperate plan to save humanity from total destructionâ€”a plan so visionary it may alter forever the future of the human race.

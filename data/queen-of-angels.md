title: Queen of Angels
description: In a world of wonders, wealth, and "perfect" mental health, a famous poet commits gruesome murder. Why?

That crime, that question, leads a policewoman to a jungle of torture and forgotten gods; a writer to the bohemian shadows of a vast city; and a scientist directly into the mind -- the nightmare soul -- of the psychopath himself.

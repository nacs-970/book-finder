title: Beggars and Choosers
description: From the back cover Tor paperback February 1996:

Nancy Kress returns to the Nebula and Hugo Award-winning world of *Beggars in Spain* to tell a new tale in an America of the future, strangely altered by genetic modifications.

Millions of ordinary people are supported by the efforts of the handsome and intellectually superior gene-modified, who are in turn running scared from the astonishing, nearly superhuman powers of the Sleepless.

Wracked by the results of irresponsible genetic research and nanotechnology, overburdened by a population of jobless drones, the whole world is on the edge of collapse.  Who will save it?  And for whom?

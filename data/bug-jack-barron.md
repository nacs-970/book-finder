title: Bug Jack Barron
description: Bug Jack Barron is a 1969 science fiction novel written by Norman Spinrad, and was a 1970 Hugo award nominee.
The story takes place in the not too distant future where an exploitative talk-show host Jack Barron gradually uncovers a conspiracy concerning an immortality treatment and the methods used in that treatment.
Although perhaps not as politically relevant as it was when first published it remains a powerful read.

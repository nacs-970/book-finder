description: A Hugo and Nebula Award Finalist novel from a Grand Master of science fiction! A modern day Genghis Khan rules the world 30 years from now, after it has been ravaged by the Virus Wars. With billions slowly dying from genetic organ rot, there aren't enough doses of the life-saving treatment.

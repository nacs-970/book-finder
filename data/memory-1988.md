description: A new edition of Book 11 in Lois McMaster Bujold's multiple New York Times best-selling space opera series, The Vokosigan Saga, winner of five Hugo awards. Forced to abandon his undercover role as leader of the Dendarii Mercenaries, Miles Vorkosigan persuades Emperor Gregor to appoint him Imperial Auditor so he can penetrate Barrayar’s intelligence and security operations, AKA ImpSec.

title: A Civil Campaign
description: Miles Vorkosigan launches a campaign to win the heart of Ekatarina, whose former husband died as a result of Miles' investigations in the book *Komarr*,  by the same author.  As a member of the Vor class, Miles and Ekatarina are constrained by many social strictures. Because Miles is politically important, he and his actions are under close scrutiny and subject to various forms of political and social attack. The book is a comedy of manners, very well done so that we seldom look up and wonder why the characters don't just cut to the chase.

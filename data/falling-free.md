title: Falling Free
description: LEO GRAF WAS AN EFFECTIVE ENGINEER... Safety Regs weren't just the rule book he swore by; he'd helped write them. All that changed on his assignment to the Cay Habitat. Leo was profoundly uneasy with the corporate exploitation of his bright new students -- till that exploitation turned to something much worse. He hadn't anticipated a situation where the right thing to do was neither safe, nor in the rules ... Leo Graf adopted 1000 quaddies -- now all he had to do was teach them to be free.

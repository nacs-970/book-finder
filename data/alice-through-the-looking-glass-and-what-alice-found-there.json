title: Alice Through the Looking-glass: And What Alice Found There
description: The sequel to 'Alice's Adventures in Wonderland' and popularly known as Alice Through the Looking Glass is at first glance the polar opposite of the first book. Set in winter, as opposed to Summer, inside as opposed to outdoors, uses different plot devices, such as mirror and chess imagery, etc but actually carries on the same themes of polymorphic characters and nonsense plotlines.

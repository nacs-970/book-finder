title: Glory Road
description: Science-Fantasy novel by Robert Heinlein, famous American writer known for 'hard' Sci-Fi. Glory Road represents his unique venture into Sci-Fan ahead of its time; first serialized in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction & then published as hardcover in 1963, & in 1964 it was nominated for Hugo Award for Best Novel. E.C. "Oscar/Scar" Gordon recovering from a combat tour in Southeast Asia reads an unusual ad in the newspaper Personals that seems to describe him (well mostly)--brave, tall, proficient weapons, engineering & math, speak French/English, travel, high pay, great adventure, & of course danger. He answers the ad, meets the beautiful girl who has many names but says he can call "Star" which later seemed appropriate for the empress of twenty universes. Space adventure, sword-play, sorcery, & more.

title: Startide Rising
description: David Brin: “Startide Rising” (1983)
 This is a sci fi story about a Terran (Earth) 
crew of neo-dolphins and humans on the starship “The Streaker”.  
Their mission is to find information about the first Galactic 
race, which existed billions of yeas ago. The neo-dolphins are 
dolphins which have gone through the "Uplift" process, which 
creates through genetic engineering  more intelligent sentient 
beings. For the neo-dolphins, this is also a test of their ability 
to apply their intelligence, knowledge and skills  to Galactic 
space travel and exploration. 
The Terrans find an ancient fleet of starships, and on a nearby 
planet, an ancient (human?) skeleton.  There are other Galactic 
races, who are also keen to find information about the first 
Galactic civilization.   Their  hot pursuit of the Terrans forces 
“The Streaker” to land on the planet Kithrup, whose watery 
environment and atmosphere are similar to Earth. Above the planet, 
the starships of the other Galactic races fight each other.  
On Kithrup, the dolphins and humans begin repairs to the Streaker, 
and to explore the ocean, and the inland area of their landing 
site.  They discover an aboriginal species living amongst the 
trees and lakes inland. There is evidence that there has 
been another Galactic race on the planet in the very distant past. 

Within the crew of the Streaker, tensions and conflicts develop on 
how to escape from Kithrup. The story centers on individual human 
and dolphin characters, and their struggle to survive and 
eventually to return to Earth with their very important findings. 
The story becomes one about courage, determination, friendship, 
love, and betrayal, both for the humans and the dolphins.
